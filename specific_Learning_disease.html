        <h1>Understanding Specific Learning Disabilities (SLDs)</h1>
        <img src="specificlearning.jpg" class="resize">
        <p>Specific Learning Disabilities (SLDs) are a group of disorders that affect the ability to learn and use academic skills, despite having average or above-average intelligence and receiving adequate instruction. These disabilities can impact areas such as reading (dyslexia), writing (dysgraphia), and mathematics (dyscalculia). Individuals with SLDs often struggle with processing and interpreting information, which can affect their academic performance and everyday functioning.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <h2>Key Characteristics of SLDs</h2>
            <p>Difficulties in acquiring, organizing, and applying academic skills, often without the presence of other factors like sensory impairments or inadequate instruction. Early identification and tailored interventions are crucial for supporting individuals with SLDs to achieve their potential.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Etiquette for Interaction</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Be Patient:</strong> Allow extra time for tasks and responses, as individuals with SLDs may need more time to process information and complete tasks.</li>
            <li><strong>Use Clear Communication:</strong> Provide instructions in a straightforward and simple manner. Avoid complex language or multi-step directions that could be confusing.</li>
            <li><strong>Offer Support:</strong> Be willing to provide additional assistance or accommodations if needed, such as extra time on assignments or access to assistive technology.</li>
            <li><strong>Avoid Making Assumptions:</strong> Understand that difficulties with learning don’t reflect a person’s intelligence or worth. Avoid jumping to conclusions about their capabilities.</li>
            <li><strong>Encourage Strengths:</strong> Focus on and celebrate the individual’s strengths and talents rather than just their challenges. This helps build confidence and motivation.</li>
            <li><strong>Respect Privacy:</strong> Be sensitive to the individual’s comfort level regarding sharing their learning disability. Avoid discussing their condition without their permission.</li>
            <li><strong>Provide Constructive Feedback:</strong> When giving feedback, focus on the task and offer specific, actionable advice rather than general criticism.</li>
        </ul>
