            <h1>Understanding Life After Leprosy</h1>
            <img src="leprose.jpg" class="resize">
            <p>Leprosy, also known as Hansen's disease, is a chronic infectious disease caused by the bacterium <i>Mycobacterium leprae</i>. It primarily affects the skin, nerves, and mucous <br> membranes. Thanks to modern medicine, leprosy is now curable, and many people who were once affected can lead healthy, normal lives after treatment.</p>
        
            <h3>Life After Being Cured of Leprosy</h3>
            <p><strong>Physical Recovery:</strong> After successful treatment, individuals may experience a range of physical improvements. Symptoms such as skin lesions and nerve damage can be managed effectively with ongoing medical care. Physical rehabilitation may be necessary to address any residual effects from the disease.</p><br>

            <p><strong>Psychosocial Impact:</strong> Being cured of leprosy can significantly impact a person's emotional and social well-being. Many individuals face stigma and discrimination due to past <br> associations with the disease. Support from family, friends, and community organizations is crucial in helping them reintegrate and overcome social barriers.</p><br>

            <p><strong>Ongoing Care and Monitoring:</strong> Although the disease is cured, regular medical follow-ups are essential to monitor for any complications or relapse. Continuous care helps manage <br> any long-term effects and ensures overall health and well-being.</p><br>

            <p><strong>Empowerment and Advocacy:</strong> Many individuals who have been cured of leprosy become advocates for raising awareness and combating stigma associated with the disease. <br> They often work with organizations to support others affected by leprosy and contribute to global health initiatives.</p>

            <h3>Etiquettes While Dealing with a Person Cured of Leprosy</h3>
            <p><strong>Respect Their Privacy:</strong> Avoid prying into their medical history or past experiences unless they choose to share. Respect their privacy and focus on their current well-being.</p><br>

            <p><strong>Avoid Stigmatizing Language:</strong> Use respectful language when referring to their past condition. Avoid terms or phrases that could be seen as judgmental or stigmatizing.</p><br>

            <p><strong>Be Supportive:</strong> Understand that they might have faced challenges related to stigma or discrimination. Offer support and encouragement, and be an ally in promoting inclusivity.</p><br>

            <p><strong>Focus on Their Achievements:</strong> Engage with them based on their current achievements and contributions. Recognize their efforts and successes beyond their past health condition.</p><br>

            <p><strong>Encourage Open Communication:</strong> If they are comfortable, encourage open discussions about their experiences and needs. Listening and responding with empathy can foster a supportive relationship.</p>
