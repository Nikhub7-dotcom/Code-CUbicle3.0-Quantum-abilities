        <h1>Understanding Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)</h1>
        <img src="autism.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a developmental condition that impacts how a person communicates, behaves,
            and interacts with others. The term "spectrum" indicates that symptoms and their severity vary widely from
            person to person. Early diagnosis and intervention are key to improving long-term outcomes.</p>

        <h2>Key Points About Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD):</h2>

        <div class="highlight">
            <h3>Types of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Definition: </strong></li>

                <li> A neurodevelopmental disorder that affects communication, behavior, and social interaction.</li>

                <li>Typically diagnosed in early childhood, though symptoms may continue or evolve throughout life.</li>
                <li><strong>Characteristics:</strong></li>
                <li>Difficulty with social interactions and understanding social cues.
                </li>
                <li>Delayed or atypical communication (both verbal and non-verbal).
                </li>
                <li>Restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities.

                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight">
            <h3>Symptoms</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Social Difficulties: </strong>Trouble understanding social norms, difficulty making eye
                    contact, and challenges forming friendships.</li>
                <li><strong>Communication Challenges: </strong>Delays in speech, lack of speech, or difficulty
                    maintaining conversations. Some individuals may use alternative forms of communication (e.g.,
                    picture boards or devices).</li>
                <li><strong>Repetitive Behaviors: </strong>Hand-flapping, rocking, spinning objects, or rigid adherence
                    to routines.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight">
            <h3>Diagnosis</h3>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Developmental Screenings:</strong> Often done in early childhood to check for delays in key
                    developmental milestones, such as speech and motor skills.</li>
                <li><strong>omprehensive Evaluation:</strong> A team of specialists, including a pediatrician,
                    psychologist, and speech-language pathologist, will conduct a full assessment, which includes:</li>
                <li>Behavioral observations.</li>
                <li>Parent and caregiver interviews.</li>
                <li>Standardized diagnostic tools like the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS).</li>
            </ul>

        </div>

        <div class="highlight">
            <h3>Treatment</h3>
            <ul>


                <li><strong> Behavioral Therapy:</strong>
                <li><strong> Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA):</strong> A widely used therapy that reinforces positive
                    behaviors and reduces harmful or challenging behaviors.
                <li><strong>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):</strong> Helps manage anxiety and emotions often
                    experienced by individuals on the autism spectrum.
                <li><strong> Speech Therapy:</strong> Helps improve verbal communication, non-verbal communication, and
                    social interaction skills.
                <li><strong> Occupational Therapy:</strong> Focuses on developing fine motor skills, coping with sensory
                    challenges, and improving daily living skills.
                <li><strong> Social Skills Training:</strong> Provides guidance on how to engage in social interactions
                    and interpret social cues.
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight">
            <h3>Management</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Individualized Education Plan (IEP):</strong> A personalized plan developed for children
                    with ASD in school, focusing on their unique educational needs.
                <li><strong>Early Intervention:</strong> Early childhood interventions, often before age 3, are critical
                    for improving social and communication skills.
                <li><strong>Family Support:</strong> Family training and support groups can help caregivers manage the
                    day-to-day challenges of caring for someone with ASD.
                <li><strong>Structured Environment:</strong> Creating a predictable routine and using visual schedules
                    or cues can help reduce anxiety and improve behavior.
            </ul>

        </div>

        <div class="highlight">
            <h3>Prevention</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>No Known Prevention:</strong> ASD is a complex, multifactorial condition with no known
                    prevention methods. However:
                <li><strong>Early Detection:</strong> Early screening and intervention can help manage symptoms and
                    improve outcomes.
                <li><strong>Healthy Pregnancy Practices:</strong> Good prenatal care, avoiding alcohol, drugs, and
                    smoking during pregnancy, and managing maternal health conditions (e.g., diabetes) can promote
                    overall child health.
