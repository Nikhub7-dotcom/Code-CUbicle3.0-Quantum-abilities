        <h1>Intellectual disability</h1>
        <p>Intellectual disability refers to limitations in both intellectual functioning (reasoning, learning,
            problem-solving) and adaptive behavior (everyday social and practical skills). It is usually present before
            the age of 18 and affects cognitive abilities and functioning.</p>

                    concepts, or have trouble with memory and concentration.</li>

                <li> Conceptual Skills: Literacy, self-direction, and understanding money.</li>
                <li>Social Skills: Interpersonal skills, social responsibility, and problem-solving in social
                    situations.</li>
