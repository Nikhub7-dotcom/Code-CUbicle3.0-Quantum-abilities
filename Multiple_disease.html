        <h1>Understanding Multiple Disabilities Including Deaf-Blindness</h1>
        <img src="deafblindness.jpg" alt="">
        <h2>Multiple Disabilities</h2>
        <p>Multiple Disabilities refer to a condition where an individual has more than one type of disability, which together create complex challenges that affect their ability to perform daily activities and interact with their environment. This term can encompass a variety of combinations of disabilities, such as physical, sensory, intellectual, or developmental impairments.</p>
        
        <h2>Deaf-Blindness</h2>
        <p>Deaf-Blindness is a specific type of multiple disability where an individual has both significant hearing and vision impairments. The combination of these sensory impairments profoundly impacts communication, mobility, and access to information, making it challenging for the individual to interact with their environment and engage in activities that typically rely on hearing and sight.</p>
