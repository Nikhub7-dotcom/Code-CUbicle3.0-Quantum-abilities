        <h1>Understanding Cerebral Palsy (CP) </h1>
        <img src="cerebral palsy.jpg" class="resize">
        <p>Cerebral Palsy (CP) is a group of neurological disorders that affect movement, posture, and muscle
            coordination. It is caused by damage to the brain, typically occurring before, during, or shortly after
            birth. CP is a lifelong condition, but its symptoms vary in severity.

        </p>

        <h2>Key Points About Cerebral Palsy (CP) :</h2>

        <div class="highlight">
            <h3>Types of Cerebral Palsy (CP) </h3>
            <ul>
                <p><strong> Hemophilia Types:</strong></p>
                <li><strong> Hemophilia A:</strong> Caused by a deficiency in clotting factor VIII.
                <li><strong> Hemophilia B:</strong> Caused by a deficiency in clotting factor IX.
                <li><strong> Hemophilia C:</strong> Caused by a deficiency in clotting factor XI (rare).
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight">
            <h3>Symptoms</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Motor Difficulties:</strong> Muscle stiffness (spasticity), floppy movements, unsteady gait,
                    and lack of coordination.
                <li><strong>Delayed Milestones: </strong>Late in reaching developmental milestones, such as sitting,
                    crawling, or walking.
                <li><strong> Involuntary Movements: </strong>Uncontrollable movements (dyskinesia), such as jerking or
                    writhing.
                <li><strong>Posture Issues: </strong>Difficulty maintaining proper posture due to muscle tone
                    abnormalities.
                <li><strong> Other Symptoms:</strong> Difficulty swallowing, drooling, problems with vision or hearing,
                    and sometimes cognitive impairments.
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight">
            <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
            <li><strong>Developmental Screening:</strong> Early assessments of motor skills, muscle tone, and
                coordination to identify delays.
            <li><strong>Brain Imaging:</strong>
            <li><strong>MRI:</strong> To detect abnormalities in brain structure.
            <li><strong>CT Scan: </strong>To identify any injuries or malformations in the brain.
            <li><strong>Genetic Testing:</strong> In some cases, to rule out other conditions that may mimic CP.
            <li><strong>Neurological Evaluations:</strong> To assess muscle tone, reflexes, and motor coordination.

                </ul>

        </div>

        <div class="highlight">
            <h3>Treatment</h3>
            <ul>


                <li><strong> Physical Therapy:</strong> Improves mobility, muscle strength, and coordination.
                <li><strong> Occupational Therapy:</strong> Helps with daily activities like dressing, eating, and using
                    adaptive equipment.
                <li><strong> Speech Therapy:</strong> Assists with speech difficulties and swallowing issues.
                <li><strong> Medications:</strong>
                <li><strong> Muscle Relaxants:</strong> To reduce muscle stiffness or spasticity (e.g., baclofen,
                    diazepam).
                <li><strong> Botox Injections: </strong>Temporarily reduce muscle stiffness.
                <li><strong> Anticonvulsants:</strong> Used if the individual has seizures.
                <li><strong> Surgery:</strong>
                <li><strong> Orthopedic Surgery:</strong> To correct joint or bone deformities caused by spasticity.
                <li><strong> Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy (SDR):</strong> A procedure to reduce spasticity by cutting
                    nerves in the spine.
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight">
            <ul>

                <li><strong>Assistive Devices:</strong> Use of mobility aids like braces, walkers, wheelchairs, and
                    communication devices.
                <li><strong> Adaptive Techniques:</strong> Strategies to improve independence in activities of daily
                    living (e.g., dressing, bathing).
                <li><strong> Multidisciplinary Approach:</strong> Involvement of healthcare professionals, including
                    neurologists, physical therapists, speech therapists, and educators.
                <li><strong> Education and Individualized Plans:</strong> Involvement in special education programs
                    tailored to the childâ€™s needs (IEP or 504 Plan in schools).
                <li><strong> Family Support and Counseling:</strong> Ongoing support for families through counseling and
                    community resources.
            </ul>

            <h3>Prevention</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Prenatal Care:</strong> Regular prenatal checkups and good maternal health can help reduce
                    the risk of CP.
                <li><strong>Preventing Premature Birth:</strong> Managing risk factors like infections or high blood
                    pressure during pregnancy.
                <li><strong>Vaccinations:</strong> To prevent infections that could lead to brain injury (e.g.,
                    rubella).
                <li><strong>Safe Delivery Practices:</strong> Monitoring for complications during birth, such as lack of
                    oxygen.
                <li><strong>Newborn Care: </strong>Prompt treatment of jaundice, infections, or other issues that could
                    lead to brain damage.
