        <h1>Sickle Cell Disease (SCD)</h1>
        <img src="sicklecell.jpg" class="resize">
        <p>Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is a group of inherited blood disorders characterized by the production of abnormal hemoglobin, known as hemoglobin S. This abnormal hemoglobin causes red blood cells to become rigid and shaped like a crescent or sickle, rather than their normal round, flexible shape. These sickle-shaped cells can obstruct blood flow in small blood vessels, leading to various complications.</p>

        <h2>Key Points About Sickle Cell Disease:</h2>

        <div class="highlight">
            <h3>Types of Sickle Cell Disease</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sickle Cell Anemia:</strong> The most common and severe form of SCD, caused by inheriting two sickle cell genes (one from each parent). It results in a high level of sickle-shaped cells in the bloodstream.</li>
                <li><strong>Sickle Hemoglobin C Disease:</strong> Caused by inheriting one sickle cell gene and one hemoglobin C gene. It is generally less severe than sickle cell anemia.</li>
                <li><strong>Sickle Beta-Thalassemia:</strong> Caused by inheriting one sickle cell gene and one beta-thalassemia gene. Severity varies depending on the type of beta-thalassemia gene.</li>
                <li><strong>Sickle Cell Trait:</strong> Individuals inherit one sickle cell gene and one normal hemoglobin gene. They typically do not have symptoms but can pass the gene to their children.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight">
            <h3>Symptoms</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pain Crises:</strong> Sudden, severe pain caused by blocked blood flow in the bones, chest, or joints.</li>
                <li><strong>Anemia:</strong> Chronic shortage of red blood cells, leading to fatigue, weakness, and pallor.</li>
                <li><strong>Swelling:</strong> Painful swelling in the hands and feet, especially in children.</li>
                <li><strong>Frequent Infections:</strong> Increased susceptibility to infections due to spleen damage.</li>
                <li><strong>Delayed Growth:</strong> Slower growth in children due to chronic anemia.</li>
                <li><strong>Vision Problems:</strong> Damage to blood vessels in the eyes can lead to vision issues.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight">
            <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Blood Tests:</strong> A blood test called hemoglobin electrophoresis is used to identify the presence of hemoglobin S and confirm the diagnosis of SCD.</li>
                <li><strong>Newborn Screening:</strong> SCD is often detected through routine newborn screening programs.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight">
            <h3>Treatment</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pain Management:</strong> Pain relief through medications and sometimes hospitalization during pain crises.</li>
                <li><strong>Hydroxyurea:</strong> A medication that helps reduce the frequency of pain crises and the need for blood transfusions.</li>
                <li><strong>Blood Transfusions:</strong> To manage severe anemia and reduce complications.</li>
                <li><strong>Bone Marrow Transplant:</strong> Potentially a cure for some patients, particularly if done early and with a suitable donor.</li>
                <li><strong>Supplemental Oxygen and Fluids:</strong> Used to manage complications and maintain proper hydration.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight">
            <h3>Management</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Regular Medical Care:</strong> Regular check-ups with a hematologist and preventive care to manage symptoms and prevent complications.</li>
                <li><strong>Vaccinations:</strong> Immunizations to protect against infections, which can be more severe in individuals with SCD.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight">
            <h3>Prevention and Genetic Counseling</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Genetic Counseling:</strong> Recommended for individuals with a family history of SCD or those in high-risk populations to understand the risk of passing the condition to offspring.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Living with Sickle Cell Disease</h2>
        <p>Individuals with SCD require ongoing management to reduce symptoms and prevent complications. With appropriate treatment and care, many people with SCD can lead fulfilling lives.</p>
