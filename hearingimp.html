            <h1>Understanding Hearing Impairment</h1>
            <p>Hearing impairment refers to a partial or total inability to hear. It can range from mild hearing loss to complete deafness. Hearing impairment can be present at birth or acquired later in life due to various factors such as age, exposure to loud noises, or medical conditions.</p><br>

            <h3>Types of Hearing Impairment</h3>
            <p><strong>Conductive Hearing Loss:</strong> This occurs when sound cannot efficiently travel through the outer ear canal to the eardrum and middle ear. It is often temporary and can be treated with medication or surgery.</p><br>

            <p><strong>Sensorineural Hearing Loss:</strong> This type involves damage to the inner ear (cochlea) or the auditory nerve. It is usually permanent and can be managed with hearing aids or cochlear implants.</p><br>

            <p><strong>Mixed Hearing Loss:</strong> A combination of conductive and sensorineural hearing loss, which may require both medical treatment and hearing aids.</p><br>

            <h3>Etiquettes While Dealing with a Person with Hearing Impairment</h3>
            <p><strong>Gain Attention Before Speaking:</strong> Get the person's attention before starting a conversation. You can gently wave your hand or lightly tap their shoulder to indicate you want to speak.</p><br>

            <p><strong>Face the Person:</strong> When speaking, face the person directly and maintain eye contact. This helps them read your lips and understand you better, especially if they rely on lip-reading.</p><br>

            <p><strong>Speak Clearly and at a Normal Pace:</strong> Speak clearly and at a moderate pace. Avoid shouting or exaggerating lip movements, as this can make lip-reading more difficult.</p><br>

            <p><strong>Use Written Communication if Necessary:</strong> If verbal communication is challenging, be prepared to use written notes or text messages to convey important information.</p><br>

            <p><strong>Be Patient and Understanding:</strong> Give the person time to process what you’re saying and respond. Avoid interrupting or finishing their sentences for them.</p><br>

            <p><strong>Ensure Accessibility:</strong> In public spaces, make sure there are visual aids or other accommodations to help those with hearing impairments, such as captioning or sign language interpreters.</p><br>

            <p><strong>Respect Communication Preferences:</strong> Ask the person about their preferred method of communication, whether it’s sign language, lip-reading, or another form of assistance, and accommodate their needs accordingly.</p>
